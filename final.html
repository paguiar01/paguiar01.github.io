    <h2>My final project was done by pair programming with a partner in the class. For ours, we decided to create a snake game. In the game, the user controls my partner's bitmoji to eat mine, which is randomly generated around the screen. As the bitmoji eats more food, images are added based on a theme that the user picks. If the user hits itself (or hits the wall in hard mode) the snake dies and the score is displayed. The user can them be taken back to the opening screen to play again, choosing a different difficulty level or theme if they wish.</h1>
